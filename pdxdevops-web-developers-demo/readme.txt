This is a presentation demo script.  The comments at the beginning of "pdxdevops-web-developers-demo.txt" describe the runtime environment used for the demo.

In order to fully reproduce the results in the script, you will need to have an AWS account and already have set up an AWS security group and access credentials.  Also, before using the "docker-machine create..." command, set the related AWS environment variables, (or hard code the parameters), as needed.

After ensuring a compatible runtime environment, copy-and-paste each of the commands in the order given.

Note that a Vagrant VBox is not required, it is merely a disposable and easily reproducible environment, very useful for the purpose creating/destroying/re-creating a demo environment as needed.  You may substitute any Linux compatible host which properly supports Docker.
