### Introduction To DevOps For Web Developers

This repository contains the files for a Libre Office Impress presentation, (itdofwd-presentation.odp).

Also, the "pdxdevops-web-developers-demo" directory contains a walk-through script which demonstrates "zero to running on AWS".  This involves creation and deployment of a very simple single page "Hello World" web site, (containing trivial PHP code).  The web page is served to the Internet by an Apache HTTP server in a Docker container, which is deployed to Amazon Web Services.  The complete walk-through is well-tested, but requires a low error-rate Internet connection; docker image pulls and repository pushes may fail if an unreliable or slow Internet connection is used, (I'm looking at you, flakey WIFI!).
